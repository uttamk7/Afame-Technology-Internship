# HR-Data-Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a detailed analysis of an HR dataset. The goal of this project is to uncover insights related to employee attrition, satisfaction, and other key HR metrics that can help in making informed decisions to improve organizational health and employee retention.

Analysis Overview
The analysis includes the following steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Importing the dataset and preparing it for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.

Attrition Analysis: Investigating the factors contributing to employee attrition.

Satisfaction and Performance Metrics: Analyzing employee satisfaction, performance ratings, and other related metrics.

Predictive Modeling: Building and evaluating models to predict employee attrition (optional, if applicable).

## Titanic Data Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset. The goal of this project is to explore the data related to the passengers of the Titanic, uncover patterns, and derive insights about the factors that affected survival rates.

Analysis Overview
The analysis includes the following steps:
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Importing the Titanic dataset and performing necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating descriptive statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution of the data and the relationships between different features.
Survival Analysis: Investigating the factors that influenced the survival rates of the passengers, including demographic information (age, sex), socio-economic status (class), and other relevant attributes.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from the existing data to improve the analysis and potential predictive modeling.
Predictive Modeling: Building and evaluating machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers based on the available features (optional, if applicable).


Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
